            <p>Posted on August 14,2024 by Author Name</p>
            <p>Love and Lemons was created by Jeanine Donofrio and her husband, Jack Mathews (“#1 taste-tester”). The blog’s name comes from the fact that Jeanine loves seasonal food, often finished off with a squeeze of lemon.
                Most of the recipes on the site are vegetarian.
                The blog was founded in 2011 and has been recognized by prestigious food magazines like Food & Wine, Food52, Refinery29, SELF Magazine, and Oprah Magazine. It was named Readers’ Choice Best Cooking Blog by Saveur Magazine in 2014 and won a Saveur Editor’s Choice award in 2016.    
                If you are looking for a recipe, you can filter your search by season, holiday, special diet, meal type, or ingredient.</p>

            <p>Posted on August 13,2024 by Author Name</p>
            <p>Cookie and Kate is all about celebrating good food. Kate is Kathryne Taylor. Cookie is her dog – which Kate describes as a “mystery mutt,” or as a DNA test found, half schipperke and half dachshund/Australian Koolie mix.
                Kate is a photographer and cook from Oklahoma. She created the blog in 2010 and now works on it full-time.  
                Like many of the other top food blogs featured here, Cookie and Kate feature vegetarian and whole food recipes.   
                The site makes it easy to search for recipes. You can look for recipes by Course, Cuisine, Diet, Everyday, Ingredient, or Season.\</p>

        <p>Minimalist Baker is one of those sites where the name says it all. It shares plant-based recipes requiring 10 ingredients or less, 1 bowl, or 30 minutes or less to prepare. It publishes a new recipe every three days, with a mixture of savory and sweet dishes.
            Dana Shultz is the blog's recipe developer and blogger. She has a deep love for recipe experimentation and food photography. She has even expanded into creating an "Essentials of Building a Great Food Blog Course."
            Despite the use of the word “baker” in the site’s name, it covers many different types of (predominantly vegan) cooking – sweets, entrees, breakfast, snacks, sides, and beverages.</p>
